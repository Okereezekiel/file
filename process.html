    <p>I am writing to share with you the process i underwent to achieve becoming a Web Developer. This journey was transformative experience that required dedication, hard work, and perseverance.</p>
    <p>It began with <b><i>getting the capital</i></b>, after secondary school, I aspired to become a web developer but due to no enough capital, I could not and it look as if I was giving up on my goals</p>
    <p>At a certain time i made up my mind to pursue my goals, then i started working and doing various kinds of jobs in order to raise capital. I worked as an computer operator and typist in a computer school(Hectos Computer Institute) where I worked for 3 months and decided to switch to another job.Although it was not easy to get, after leaving the mentioned school (Hectos Computer Institute), I stayed home for 1 months. </p>
    <p>One morning I decided to go look for a job, and by the grace of God I found a job where I worked as a sales boy for 6 month in order to gather enough capital.</p>
    <p>Throughout the process, I encountered challenges that tested my resolve.However,I overcame them.</p>
    <p>One of the most significant milestone was me being able to raise the capital for my aspirations,which marked a turning point in my journey.It was a moment of triumph that motivated me to continue pushing forward.</p>
    <p>By God's grace I gathered enough capital to begin my journey. The final stage involved looking for a good tech school, God helping me I came across a school (Flip to Tech) and had interest in the school, then settled the needs to start a tech career,though it was not easy but God helping me and I started a tech career.</p>
    <p>Reflecting on this journey, I realize that the Process was just as important as the outcome. I learned valueable skills and developed a growth mindset that will benefit me in the future endeavors</p>
    <p>I hope that sharing my process will inspire and motivate you to pursue your own goals and aspirations.</p>
